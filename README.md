SemEval-2014
============

This project is our entry in [SemEval 2014 Task 8: Broad-Coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task8/).
The plan is for the project to be a mix of Java and Scala, with the expectation that the majority of team members will be contributing in Java.

The project can be compiled and run with sbt
([installing sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html),
[running sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Running.html)).

The system is described in:
[CMU: Arc-Factored, Discriminative Semantic Dependency Parsing](http://samthomson.com/papers/thomson+etal.semeval2014.pdf).

We also have a newer, more accurate [system](https://github.com/Noahs-ARK/NeurboParser), as described in the following paper:
[Deep Multitask Learning for Semantic Dependency Parsing](http://samthomson.com/papers/peng+etal.acl2017.pdf).
