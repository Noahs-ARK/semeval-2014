@inproceedings{weinberger_feature_2009,
	Abstract = {Empirical evidence suggests that hashing is an effective strategy for dimensionality reduction and practical nonparametric estimation. In this paper we provide exponential tail bounds for feature hashing and show that the interaction between random subspaces is negligible with high probability. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with experimental results for a new use case --- multitask learning with hundreds of thousands of tasks.},

@article{duchi_adaptive_2011,
	Abstract = {We present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform more informative gradient-based learning. Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.},

@inproceedings{johansson_dependency-based_2008,
	Address = {Honolulu, {HI}, USA},
	Abstract = {We present a {PropBank} semantic role labeling system for English that is integrated with a dependency parser. To tackle the problem of joint syntactic--semantic analysis, the system relies on a syntactic and a semantic subcomponent. The syntactic model is a projective parser using pseudo-projective transformations, and the semantic model uses global inference mechanisms on top of a pipeline of classifiers. The complete syntactic-semantic output is selected from a candidate pool generated by the subsystems. We evaluate the system on the {CoNLL-2005} test sets using segment-based and dependency-based metrics. Using the segment-based {CoNLL-2005} metric, our system achieves a near state-of-the-art F1 figure of 77.97 on the {WSJ+Brown} test set, or 78.84 if punctuation is treated consistently. Using a dependency-based metric, the F1 figure of our system is 84.29 on the test set from {CoNLL-2008.} Our system is the first dependency-based semantic role labeler for {PropBank} that rivals constituent-based systems in terms of performance.},

	abstract = {Past empirical work has shown that learning multiple related tasks from data simultaneously can be advantageous in terms of predictive performance relative to learning these tasks independently. In this paper we present an approach to multi--task learning based on the minimization of regularization functionals similar to existing ones, such as the one for Support Vector Machines ({SVMs}), that have been successfully used in the past for single--task learning. Our approach allows to model the relation between tasks in terms of a novel kernel function that uses a task--coupling parameter. We implement an instance of the proposed approach similar to {SVMs} and test it empirically using simulated as well as real data. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than existing multi--task learning methods and largely outperforms single--task learning using {SVMs}.},
